## Project Overview

This project is part of the Introduction to Data Science (6101-12) course at The George Washington University (Fall 2025, Master’s level).

We examine the variation in per capita protein and fat supplies between developing countries in the Global South and developed countries in the Global North. Using the 2022 FAO Food Balance Sheets from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
, we measure and compare the average daily per capita supply (in grams) of protein and fat across regional groups.

Our analysis is implemented in R, with a workflow that includes raw data acquisition, cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

## Objectives
- Quantify and compare per capita protein and fat supplies across Global South and Global North countries.
- Visualize regional disparities in nutritional intake.
- Provide insights relevant to food security and nutrition policy
